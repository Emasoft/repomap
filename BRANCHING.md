# Branch Strategy

- **master** - Current head, integration branch
- **dev** - Active development branch
- **release** - Latest stable version of the code

Normal workflow:
1. Development happens in the dev branch
2. When features are ready, merge dev into master
3. After testing and verification, merge master into release
